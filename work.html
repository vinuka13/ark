                        temporary home while we worked hard to find her the forever home she deserves. And 
                        guess what, a kind lady from colombo 
                        volunteered to adopt her, despite the distance and the cost of transport. In no time
                         she was vaccinated and heading to her new home.
                        The pictures on the left side is the most recent, taken a few days ago. She has found
                         a home among a loving family of two kids. She is 
                        loved and well taken care of and nothing pleases us more than seen her living her best
                         life after a traumatic beginning. </h3>

                        nothing about treating  dog right. As you can see 
                      in the picture on the left, she was malnourished, chained and has a sever rash all 
                      over her body. Her pups were in no better condition.
                      However, despite the traumatic start, Lily was lucky to be seen by a kind lady 
                      adopted her and we were also able to find homes for her
                      pups. You can see how happy and healthy Lily is after a few months of good care and 
                      lots of love.  Like they say, we can't change the world
                      but we can be the change we like to see in it!</h3>
